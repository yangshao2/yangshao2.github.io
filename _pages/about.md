I am an Associate Professor in the department of Geography at Virginia Tech. I am broadly interested in remote sensing digital image processing, GIS, and statistical modelling. In an era marked by the growing accessibility of remotely sensed data and rapid evolution of machine learning algorithms, my research primarily focuses on developing effective methods to extract and analyze land cover and land use information (including urban areas, agricultural lands, and forests). These efforts aim to monitor and understand changes in these landscapes from local to continental scales. 

In a separate, yet intrinsically connected research direction, I am engaged in the development of computational tools designed to simulate eco-hydrological processes. My current research in urban environmental studies is focused on refining existing stormwater models, such as the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The objective is to enhance the representation of land cover and evapotranspiration within these models. This refinement is important in deepening our understanding of the role urban forests play in mitigating flood risks.
